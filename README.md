#Group assignment 4#

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the RAG retrieval system, use transformer models and storing it in a database, do prompt engineering, evaluate difference in results and demonstrating it in deployed application, like gradio.
For this assignment we utilized an introductory book to deep learning, which was the processed and vectorized and saved in a database using ChromaDB. 
Utilizing LLama GPTQ model, we made queries which the model sought to answer with information retrieved from the database, we tried different ways of prompting the model, utilizing the same three questions to see how it would perform.
Finally we deployed the RAG system with gradio, with our choice of prefered prompt.
